# cons

1. mounting holes should be 1.65mm radius
2. smd components should be placed considering conveniend desoldering with heatgun
3. inputs of unused op amps should be grounded
4. power socket footprint is a bit smaller
5. power socket is mounted the wrong side to psu (not very nice ribbon locking)
6. maybe use horizontal footprint for triac
7. no debug leds and pins (fan, heater, phase detector, buttons line, maybe lcd, thermosensor and after amplification)

# procs

1. resistor nominal on silkscreen is nice
